#### About Professions

These professions are intended to simplify the act of assigning roles to your Dwarves. Furthermore, I'm using a tiered approach to allow unskilled dwarves perform a variety of related tasks, while your experienced dwarves focus one a specific task.

All roles are prefixed with symbols to act as an at-a-glance categorization.

| Symbol | Description |
|:-:|---|
| @ | Generic Profession |
| *@ | Specific Profession (One task) |
| $@$ | Noble |
| [@] | Soldier/Military |
